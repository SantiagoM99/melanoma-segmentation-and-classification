Melanoma Segmentation documentation
===================================

Welcome to the documentation for the **Melanoma Segmentation Project**. This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for detecting and segmenting melanoma lesions in medical images. It includes tools for managing datasets, implementing and training state-of-the-art models, evaluating performance with robust metrics, and visualizing results.

This documentation is for the `melanoma_segmentation` package, which can be found on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/melanoma-segmentation/). The package is designed to streamline the development and evaluation of segmentation models for melanoma detection and skin lesion analysis.
Explore the sections below to learn more about the components of the project.
